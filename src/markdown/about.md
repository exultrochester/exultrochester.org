Exult Rochester was formed in the fall of 2014 with the support of the Catholic Diocese of Rochester, NY.

Our mission is simple; support men along their faith journey and support the formation and growth of parish-based men’s groups.

With the help of many people within the diocese, from our Bishop, the Most Reverend Salvatore Matano, numerous priests, deacons, seminarians, religious, and laypeople, we have grown into a team dedicated to supporting men along their faith journey with Christ.

TODO: Rewrite the following

We successfully held our inaugural men's conference in May 2015 at St Judes Catholic Church in Gates, NY.  Over 400 men attended and made the day a great success.

This year, we will be holding our 2nd annual conference on Oct 1, 2016 at St Judes Catholic Church in Gates, NY.

Conferences are just the start of what we are striving for. Our goal includes supporting men along their faith journey and to become disciples of Christ.

With diocesan support, we have a formal program in place to assist parishes in establishing men's groups.

If you are interested in obtaining support and program guidance in the development of your parish-based men's group, please contact us and we will gladly assist.
