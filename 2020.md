    descriptionMarkdown: |-
      I am a Catholic catechist, speaker, and writer living in Birmingham, Alabama. I also host the EWTN Radio Program Called to Communion.  I grew up in the Presbyterian Church (PCA) and attended a Protestant college and seminary. During my Ph.D. studies in Reformation History, I became persuaded of the truth of the Catholic Faith. (Read about it here.) I entered the Church in 2003, along with my wonderful wife, Jill, and my (now) five children. I speak at conferences, parishes, debates, and other venues.
  - name: Troy Guy
    tagline: Catholic Apologist & Nuclear Engineer

    descriptionMarkdown: |-
      Troy Guy converted to the Catholic Church after being an
      anti-Catholic Baptist for over 25 years. His ministry helps
      Catholics defend their faith against ongoing attacks from both
      secular culture and anti-Catholic fundamentalists. His book,
      Evangelical Catholic, which received the Imprimatur by Cardinal
      Daniel DiNardo, describes his experience discovering the
      Catholic faith and presents the indisputable Biblical and
      historical evidence that led him to convert. As a nationally
      recognized speaker on Catholic apologetics, Troy has appeared
      on EWTN TV, The Journey Home Show, and is a frequent guest
      on Catholic radio programs.

      Currently, he is a Principle Engineer for a spacecraft
      designed to conduct human missions to the Moon. He began
      his career in nuclear science, performing high energy atomic
      experiments for the Department of Defense and Department of
      Energy. Troy is a graduate of Texas A&amp;M University. He holds
      degrees in Electrical Engineering, Nuclear Engineering, and
      Physics. He is a pilot and flight instructor for multi-engine
      aircraft.  Troy and his wife, Lisa, have four children and live in
      Texas.
